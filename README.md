## Overview

This was a challenge a little harder than it sounds. I had already seen the accordion list in the JS course I'm studying, but I decided to accept the proposed challenge of doing it only with HTML and CSS. Resolving this was fine, but I had some problems with the responsiveness of the layout, which took me a lot of time. There are still some details to be resolved, but I think the work done so far is quite satisfactory and it's good to see the power of HTML and CSS against challenges that previously involved JavaScript to be resolved.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I got the details tag tip by doing the LinkedIn HTML test. From there, it was a matter of learning how to deal with the tag in CSS, which was very simple. However, as I said, I had some problems with responsiveness, among others, how to position the elements, especially the images. Although the layout is very simple, these questions gave me a job that I didn't have in the last few challenges, which served to make me think of solutions that subvert what I had already thought of before, which was very stressful but fun in the end.
